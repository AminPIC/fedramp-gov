  <p>In a constantly changing IT landscape, the migration of on-premise technologies to the cloud has only increased. Agencies have the opportunity to save money and time by adopting innovative cloud services to meet their critical mission needs. Agencies are required by law to protect any federal information that is collected, maintained, processed, disseminated, or disposed of by cloud service offerings, in accordance with FedRAMP requirements. 
FedRAMP is a unique government program that is at the epicenter of cloud technology, cyber security, and risk management. FedRAMP provides a standardized framework to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This framework uses a “do once, use many times” approach that saves an estimated 30-40% of government authorization costs, by reducing both time and staff required to conduct agency security assessments. FedRAMP maintains a Marketplace of all vendors that hold a FedRAMP designation, as well as a Secure Repository for all of the authorization packages for FedRAMP Authorized vendors.</p>

<h2 id="fedramp-authorization-an-agencys-perspective">FedRAMP Authorization: An Agency’s Perspective</h2>

<p>FedRAMP facilitates collaboration across the federal government and enables effective stakeholder alignment during the FedRAMP authorization process. Prior to engaging a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), it is important that agencies understand their technical requirements, to include determination of the type of cloud service/scope of services needed, cloud deployment model, data sensitivities, and other pertinent information.</p>

<h3 id="pre-authorization">Pre-Authorization</h3>

<p>Agencies should begin by defining their mission needs and specific requirements for a Cloud Services Offering (CSO), and research potential providers. We recommend agencies first check the FedRAMP Marketplace to see if there is a CSO that meets their needs that has already started the FedRAMP process or is authorized. Agencies interested in a CSO that is already FedRAMP Authorized should request access to their package through our Package Request Form. Agencies interested in a CSO that is In Process should inquire about their status by contacting the CSP directly, or e-mailing agency@fedramp.gov.
Agencies interested in acquiring a provider who is not yet FedRAMP Authorized or FedRAMP In Process should contact the PMO to learn more about how to partner with the CSP to issue a FedRAMP authorization. We recommend reviewing our Agency Authorization Playbook for more information on the Initial Authorization process, and our In Process Requirements for information about how to establish a partnership with a CSP.
Agencies having difficulty selecting a CSO should reach out to agency@fedramp.gov. The PMO would be happy discuss options and share lessons learned from other Agencies.</p>
<h3 id="during-authorization">During Authorization</h3>

<p>To issue an Authority to Operate (ATO) for a provider that is already FedRAMP Authorized, Agencies should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct a risk analysis by reviewing the CSP authorization package</li>
  <li>Determine if the risk posture is acceptable</li>
  <li>Determine if the CSP needs to meet additional requirements for Agency mission/business needs</li>
  <li>Approve the CSP package for authorization</li>
  <li>Issue an ATO for the CSP service/system</li>
  <li>Send the ATO letter to the FedRAMP PMO: info@fedramp.gov</li>
</ul>

<p>If an Agency is working with a CSP who is not yet FedRAMP Authorized, they will perform the initial authorization for the CSO. An Agency should first communicate their partnership with FedRAMP in accordance with our In Process Requirements. The authorization process begins with a kick-off discussion among all stakeholders. Following kick-off, the CSP and assessor begin system vulnerability testing of the cloud service offering and consolidate security documentation within the security authorization package. An Agency’s role in authorization is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain open communication with the CSP and independent assessor to provide clarity and answer questions regarding specific security control requirements</li>
  <li>Review the CSP security authorization package, which includes:
..* System Security Plan (SSP) detailing the CSP’s system security environment
..* System Assessment Plan (SAP) detailing the independent assessors approach for vulnerability testing of the CSP’s system
..* System Assessment Report (SAR) detailing the independent assessor’s findings and recommendations pursuant to performance of the SAP, and</li>
  <li>Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&amp;M) detailing the CSP and independent assessor’s approach to addressing or identifying system vulnerabilities as well as the approach to continuous monitoring of the system</li>
  <li>Direct the CSP for remediation of security vulnerabilities identified in the SAR, as needed
Perform final review of a security authorization package, with a focus toward understanding the risk posture the Agency must accept by using the cloud service</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main-players">Main Players</h3>
<p>There are three main players in the FedRAMP process: Agencies, CSPs, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs). Agencies are responsible for selecting a cloud service, leveraging the FedRAMP Process, and requiring CSPs to meet FedRAMP requirements. CSPs provide the actual cloud service to an Agency, and must meet all FedRAMP requirements before they implement their services. 3PAOs perform initial and periodic assessment of CSP systems per FedRAMP requirements, provide evidence of compliance, and play an on-going role in ensuring CSPs meet requirements.  FedRAMP provisional authorizations (P-ATOs) must include an assessment by an accredited 3PAO to ensure a consistent assessment process.</p>

<h3 id="key-processes">Key Processes</h3>
<p>FedRAMP authorizes cloud systems in a three step process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Security Assessment: The security assessment process uses a standardized set of requirements in accordance with FISMA using a baseline set of NIST 800-53 controls to grant security authorizations.</li>
  <li>Leveraging and Authorization:  Federal agencies view security authorization packages in the FedRAMP repository and leverage the security authorization packages to grant a security authorization at their own agency.</li>
  <li>Ongoing Assessment &amp; Authorization:  Once an authorization is granted, ongoing assessment and authorization activities must be completed to maintain the security authorization.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="governance">Governance</h3>
<p>FedRAMP is a government-wide program with input from numerous departments, agencies, and government groups. The program’s primary decision-making body is the Joint Authorization Board (JAB), comprised of the CIOs from DOD, DHS, and GSA.  In addition to the JAB, OMB, the Federal CIO Council, NIST, DHS, and the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) play keys roles in effectively running FedRAMP.</p>
